## Domain Constraints and Business Rules

- Rearing styles are restricted to:
  - backyard
  - commercial
  Enforcement is implemented in [shared/utils/errorHandling.js](shared/utils/errorHandling.js:124). Any other value will raise a validation error. Web and mobile pickers expose only these two options.

- Progressive feeding for broilers:
  - Shared logic defaults to progressive feeding; see [shared/utils/feedCalculator.js](shared/utils/feedCalculator.js:523).
  - Mobile logic explicitly enforces progressive feeding; see [mobile/lib/feedCalculator.js](mobile/lib/feedCalculator.js:196).
  There is no UI toggle to disable progressive feeding.

## Centralized Pricing Configuration

- Pricing lives in [shared/utils/pricingConfig.js](shared/utils/pricingConfig.js:1)
  - FEED_PRICES provides pricePerBag and bagSizeKg per band
  - getPricePerKg(feedType) computes price per kg
  - updateFeedPrice(feedType, { pricePerBag, bagSizeKg }) allows runtime updates (e.g., admin tools)

- Cost integration uses centralized pricing in [shared/utils/feedCalculator.js](shared/utils/feedCalculator.js:939).

Example runtime update:
```js
import { updateFeedPrice } from '../shared/utils/pricingConfig.js';
updateFeedPrice('starter', { pricePerBag: 26000, bagSizeKg: 25 });
```

## Performance

- Feed progression memoization reduces redundant per-day computations:
  - Implemented in [shared/utils/feedProgression.js](shared/utils/feedProgression.js:30)
  - Cache key includes birdType, breed, rearingStyle, targetWeight, quantity, feedingSystem, environmental, and day

## Testing

- Jest configured at repo root with babel-jest transform for ESM syntax:
  - Config: [jest.config.js](jest.config.js:1)
  - Scripts: [package.json](package.json:10) leverage Node VM modules for compatibility
  - Babel preset targets current Node in [package.json](package.json:50)
  - Tests: ./tests covering validation, pricing, and progression memoization

Run:
```bash
npm install
npm test
```

## üìä Build Results
