# Chicken Feed Calculator

## Rearing Styles

Rearing styles are restricted to two options:
- backyard
- commercial

Validation is enforced in [shared/utils/errorHandling.js](shared/utils/errorHandling.js:124). Any other value (e.g., free-range, organic) will throw a validation error.

UI pickers in both web and mobile expose only these two options.

## Progressive Feeding (Broilers)

Progressive daily feeding is enforced for broilers across layers to align with performance and accuracy goals. Callers do not need to toggle this; it is applied by default in shared logic and explicitly enforced in mobile logic.
- Shared logic uses progressive feeding by default within [shared/utils/feedCalculator.js](shared/utils/feedCalculator.js:523).
- Mobile logic unconditionally applies progressive feeding for broilers in [mobile/lib/feedCalculator.js](mobile/lib/feedCalculator.js:196).

## Centralized Pricing Configuration

Feed pricing is centrally managed in [shared/utils/pricingConfig.js](shared/utils/pricingConfig.js:1). Use:
- FEED_PRICES for current bag prices and sizes
- getPricePerKg(feedType) to compute current price per kg
- updateFeedPrice(feedType, { pricePerBag, bagSizeKg }) to adjust runtime pricing (e.g., via admin tools)

Costing integrates pricingConfig in [shared/utils/feedCalculator.js](shared/utils/feedCalculator.js:939).

Example:
```js
import { updateFeedPrice } from '../shared/utils/pricingConfig.js';

updateFeedPrice('starter', { pricePerBag: 26000 });
// Subsequent calls to calculateFeedCost reflect updated price.
```

## Testing

Jest is configured at the repo root with Babel transform for ESM syntax in source.
- Config: [jest.config.js](jest.config.js:1)
- Scripts: see [package.json](package.json:10) ("test", "test:watch")
- Tests located under ./tests

Run:
```bash
npm install
npm test
```
